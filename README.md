## **Overview**
Home automation, Smart Institute, Home control, and digital home are different names for systems designed to provide comfort, convenience, security, and power savings. These systems are gaining importance in today's world. While they can be expensive, they can also be cost-effective when tailored to specific needs. This project aims to create a new generation of smart automation systems that allow users to control home appliances and industrial/institutional devices from anywhere via the Internet or mobile apps on open-source platforms like Android.


## **Project Modules**
This project consists of three major modules:

**1.** **Client Server:** The heart of the system that manages communication between devices, users, and sensors.
**2**. **Radio Frequency Transceiver:** Enables wireless communication between devices.
**3.** **Microcontroller:** The brain of the system responsible for controlling appliances and sensors.


## **Features**
- Control home appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, fans, bulbs, industrial appliances, and institutional devices remotely.
- Access the system through a personal computer or smartphone.
- Develop a user interface through mobile apps for controlling appliances.
- Expand the system effortlessly with additional relay circuits or sensors.
- Support both manual and autonomous automation techniques.
- Handle multiple sensors simultaneously without affecting relay operations.
- Project Structure
- The project comprises two main sections:

## **Hardware**
This section involves building the physical components of the system, including:

- Circuit construction
- Printed circuit board (PCB) etching
- Soldering processes
- Relay circuit for appliance control
- Sensor integration (e.g., IR sensor, LED display)

## **Software**
The software section focuses on:

- Designing algorithms
- Coding and compilation
- User interface development
- Integration of the NodeMCU microcontrollers
- Server setup for communication
- Mobile app development (optional)

## **How It Works**
- The system consists of two NodeMCU microcontrollers connected to the same server and the internet.
- One NodeMCU handles the relay circuit for appliance control, allowing users to expand their existing automation board.
- The other NodeMCU manages additional sensors, facilitating the addition of new sensors to the existing circuit.
- Users can control appliances via a mobile application, and the system supports multiple sensors simultaneously.

## **Challenges Addressed**
- Simplifying the process of expanding or upgrading existing automation systems.
- Enabling users to expand relay circuits and add new sensors conveniently.
- Providing support for both manual and autonomous automation techniques.

## **Usage**
To use this system, follow these steps:

- Set up the hardware components, including the relay circuit and sensors.
- Connect the NodeMCU microcontrollers to the server and the internet.
- Install the mobile application (if available) to control appliances remotely.
- Enjoy the benefits of a flexible and expandable home automation system.
